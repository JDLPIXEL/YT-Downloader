## Description

Hello :),

I hereby place my YouTube downloader programmed in Python under a free use and also further development of the source code.

You can download the different releases on the right side on GitHub and edit them locally on your computer.

In the future, the setup files will also appear for immediate download as soon as I have repackaged them.
Alternatively, you can download and use the latest full version 2.3 from [my website](https://jdlpixel.de/download).
